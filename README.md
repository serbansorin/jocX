### Erou VS Monstru


The game was made during one night, I still can't remember exactly.
The original plan 2 files config and play would be the only files while in index.php, I would instantiate the 2 caracters and call a static function as the play engine.
WHY I DIDN'T DO IT LIKE I PLANNED TO? Well one of the assignment was to leave room in case the would evolve. So I made one too many classes.

I put all their special powers, gifts and stats, like health,strength, attack,defense,luck,etc, in one file named config.

Eroul ataca Monstrul,

Game's config in Models/config.php; returns as an array

TODO: Move action into a static function
TODO: Remove all comments; make new ones
TODO: Move special gifts and special move // transform into functions


TODO: MOVE THE ACTION between play class and caracter class.
